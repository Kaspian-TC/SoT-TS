# SoT-TS
This program takes in a series of coordinates and returns a path using Kruskal's algorithm that approximates the traveling salesman problem.
The purpose of this algorithm is for going between islands in the game sea of thieves, hence the many references to islands.
As input, type a letter and then one or two numbers (ie, a1, z99).


The function `findMinRoute` in TS.c returns an adjacency list
